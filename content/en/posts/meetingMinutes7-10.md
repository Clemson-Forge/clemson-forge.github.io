### Internships x Resume Tips:

- Helpful Website: [https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships/blob/dev/README.md](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships/blob/dev/README.md)
- Archived Website (helpful to see previous internships that might be available later for 2025): [https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships/blob/dev/archived/README-2024.md](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships/blob/dev/archived/README-2024.md)
- Create job alerts on Indeed, LinkedIn, or other websites to get alerted as soon as a new application has been posted.
- Use a resume template to make the process of applying easier.
- Change/add keywords regarding the job post rather than using the same resume for all job applications.
- Since AI is used to look at resumes, you can use Chat GPT 4.0 to help with resume optimization.
- Send a message to a recruiter through LinkedIn in order to connect with them.
- Connections matter, if you know someone or their parents who work somewhere you want to work, ask them if you can connect with the recruiter when you are looking for an internship.
  - You can tell the recruiter that (name) referred me to you for a job posting rather than saying Iâ€™m looking for this specific internship.
- Set aside time to look for internship postings and applying, especially if you procrastinate, it will help you in the long run.
- There is Clemson Job Link for more local job opportunities and any companies that partner with the university. The Clemson Career Center can also help you with your resume.
- Create a portfolio website to show you have experience in frontend and to display your projects.

### Portfolio Website:
- Use a template for saving time and for experience.
