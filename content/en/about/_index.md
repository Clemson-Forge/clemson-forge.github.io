Our mission is to help bridge the gap between academic coursework and real-world applications by providing CS students with opportunities outside of their curriculum.
Through mentorship, personal project development, and career guidance, we empower our members to take ownership of their learning and prepare themselves for careers and other future opportunities.

We have weekly meetings on *Saturdays* at *the Watt Family Innovation Center*.
